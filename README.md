# Hello-World
My First Repository

Hello all and Welcome

My name is Alexander (Alex for short) and i am a programmer 

I've been coding since before the invention of smartphones(Hold the jokes)and i've always loved it.

lets see now i've completed Mechanical & Electronic Engineering courses and Computer Sciences, i am currently working towards my Masters in Design and Innovation(engineering side obviously)
I've never worked in these fields Professionally until recently as i've always believed that if your job is your hobby then it kills the passion, maybe thats just me

I've recently started work on Two Projects the First is a Mobile Based Strategy Game and the Second is an Operating System with a unique Machine learning based UI. 

The reason i've chosen to bring my skill to bear now is simple: I have a 10 month old daughter who i absolutely adore and i don't want to miss a sigle day of her developement. Programming allows me to Work from home = Best of both worlds = I am one Very Happy man

so thats me in a nutshell 

any questions please feel free to ask
